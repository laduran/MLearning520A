## Lesson 01 Overview

Introduction to Advanced Machine Learning and Real-World Application


### Learning Topics 
 - Supervised learning
   - Regression
   - Binary classification
   - Multi-class classification
 - Review
   - Linear model vs. Non-linear model
   - Regularization
   - Hyper-parameters
   - Model evaluation
 - Case Study

### Learning Objectives

You will be able to:

 - Implement two strategies for multiclass classification (lab).
 - Apply implementation to data set .
 - Apply insights gained from exploring a real-world case to thinking about how to address real-world problems, starting with a machine learning problem, then applying techniques.

### Before Class
